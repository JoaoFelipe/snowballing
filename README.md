Snowballing
==========

This project provides tools for perfoming a liberature review through snowballing. It includes Jupyter Notebook widgets that assist the backward and forward steps of literature snowballing, notebooks that assist in inserting citations in the database, and notebooks for analyzing the snowballing and producing citation graphs, publication place histograms, and a summarization of the snowballing steps.

This package was tested on Python 3.6 using Windows, but it should support Python > 3.5 in any operating system. Please, open an issue if it is not the case.


Getting started
------------------

To install the tool, you should follow these instructions:

- First, install the python package:
  - `$ pip install snowballing `

- Then, download and install the latest [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
  - In my case, I put the 'geckodriver.exe' file in the Firefox directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox`)
  - And I add the directory to the PATH environment variable
  
- If you want to export the snowballing history (provenance), you must also install the following tools
  - [provtoolbox](http://lucmoreau.github.io/ProvToolbox/)
  - [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

For starting a new literature review project, please run:
```bash
$ snowballing start literature
```
This command will create a directory called `literature` (you are free to use other name in the command) with the notebooks for performing the snowballing and analyzing it, and an example database.


Inside the directory, start Jupyter:
```bash
$ cd literature
$ jupyter notebook
```

And open the file [Index.ipynb](example/Index.ipynb). This file contains all the instructions for understanding the database and performing the snowballing.

Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project!

For installing in development mode, clone the repository and use `pip install -e`:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:JoaoFelipe/snowballing.git
$ cd snowballing
$ pip install -e snowballing
```

Notes
----

This project started as part of a literature snowballing. The tools were developped out of necessity in a adhoc way. Thus, it has some bad design decisions, such as using Python scripts as a database, and choosing field names that are far from ideal.

Contributions to fix these and other issues are welcome! If you are going to change a field name that is used by the tool, please, try to make it configurable.
