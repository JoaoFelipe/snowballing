Snowballing
===========

This project provides tools for perfoming a liberature review through
snowballing. It includes Jupyter Notebook widgets that assist the
backward and forward steps of literature snowballing, notebooks that
assist in inserting citations in the database, and notebooks for
analyzing the snowballing and producing citation graphs, publication
place histograms, and a summarization of the snowballing steps.

This package was tested on Python 3.6 using Windows, but it should
support Python > 3.5 in any operating system. Please, open an issue if
it is not the case.
